"1911109,4811434,",1778088,How do I clone a single branch in Git?,"
I have a local Git repository called 'skeleton' that I use for storing project skeletons. It has a few branches, for different kinds of projects:
casey@agave [~/Projects/skeleton] git branch
* master
  rails
  c
  c++

If I want to check out the master branch for a new project, I can do
casey@agave [~/Projects] git clone skeleton new
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/casey/Projects/new/.git/

and everything is how I want it. Specifically, the new master branch points to the skeleton master branch, and I can push and pull to move around changes to the basic project setup.
What doesn't work, however, is if I want to clone another branch. I can't get it so that I only pull the branch I want, for instance the rails branch, and then the new repository has a master branch that pushes to and pulls from the skeleton repository's rails branch, by default.
Is there a good way to go about doing this? Or, maybe this isn't the way that Git wants me to structure things, and I'm certainly open to that. Perhaps I should have multiple repositories, with the Ruby on Rails skeleton repository tracking the master skeleton repository? And any individual project cloning the Ruby on Rails skeleton repository.

Came across this link: http://linux.yyz.us/git-howto.html which was quite useful.
The tools to compare branches I've come across are:

git diff master..branch

Was wondering if there's something like ""git status master..branch"" to only see those files that are different between the two branches.
Without creating a new tool, I think this is the closest you can get to do that now (which of course will show repeats if a file was modified more than once):

"5137497,4934806,",3718657,How do you properly determine the current script directory in Python?,"
I would like to see what is the best way to determine the current script directory in Python.
I discovered that, due to the many ways of calling Python code, it is hard to find a good solution.
Here are some problems:

__file__ is not defined if the script is executed with exec, execfile
__module__ is defined only in modules

Use cases:

./myfile.py
python myfile.py
./somedir/myfile.py
python somedir/myfile.py
execfile('myfile.py') (from another script, that can be located in another directory and that can have another current directory.

I know that there is no perfect solution, but I'm looking for the best approach that solves most of the cases.
The most used approach is os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) but this really doesn't work if you execute the script from another one with exec().
Warning
Any solution that uses current directory will fail, this can be different based on the way the script is called or it can be changed inside the running script.

Words of Warning (update)
REMOTE_ADDR still represents the most reliable source of an IP address. The other $_SERVER variables mentioned here can be spoofed by a remote client very easily. The purpose of this solution is to attempt to determine the IP address of a client sitting behind a proxy. For your general purposes, you might consider using this in combination with the IP address returned directly from $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] and storing both.
For 99.9% of users this solution will suit your needs perfectly. It will not protect you from the 0.1% of malicious users looking to abuse your system by injecting their own request headers. If relying on IP addresses for something mission critical, resort to REMOTE_ADDR and don't bother catering to those behind a proxy.

overflow:auto
overflow:hidden

In my situation, the only one that seems to work correctly is the <br clear=""all""/> solution, which is a little bit scruffy. overflow:auto gives me nasty scrollbars, and overflow:hidden must surely have side effects.

"1165761,",803225,When should I use double instead of decimal?,"
I can name three advantages to using double (or float) instead of decimal:

Uses less memory.
Faster because floating point math operations are natively supported by processors.
Can represent a larger range of numbers.

But these advantages seem to apply only to calculation intensive operations, such as those found in modeling software. Of course, doubles should not be used when precision is required, such as financial calculations. So are there any practical reasons to ever choose double (or float) instead of decimal in ""normal"" applications?
Edited to add:
Thanks for all the great responses, I learned from them.
One further question: A few people made the point that doubles can more precisely represent real numbers. When declared I would think that they usually more accurately represent them as well. But is it a true statement that the accuracy may decrease (sometimes significantly) when floating point operations are performed?

"3357553,",2010892,Storing Objects in HTML5 localStorage,"
I'd like to store a JavaScript object in HTML5 localStorage, but my object is apparently being converted to a string.
I can store and retrieve primitive JavaScript types and arrays using localStorage, but objects don't seem to work.  Should they? 
Here's my code:
var testObject = { 'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3 };
console.log('typeof testObject: ' + typeof testObject);
console.log('testObject properties:');
for (var prop in testObject) {
    console.log('  ' + prop + ': ' + testObject[prop]);
}

// Put the object into storage
localStorage.setItem('testObject', testObject);

// Retrieve the object from storage
var retrievedObject = localStorage.getItem('testObject');

console.log('typeof retrievedObject: ' + typeof retrievedObject);
console.log('Value of retrievedObject: ' + retrievedObject);

The console output is
typeof testObject: object
testObject properties:
  one: 1
  two: 2
  three: 3
typeof retrievedObject: string
Value of retrievedObject: [object Object]

It looks to me like the setItem method is converting the input to a string before storing it.
I see this behavior in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox, so I assume it's my misunderstanding of the HTML5 Web Storage spec, not a browser-specific bug or limitation.
I've tried to make sense of the structured clone algorithm described in http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html.  I don't fully understand what it's saying, but maybe my problem has to do with my object's properties not being enumerable (???)  
Is there an easy workaround?

Update: The W3C eventually changed their minds about the structured-clone specification, and decided to change the spec to match the implementations.  See https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=12111. So this question is no longer 100% valid, but the answers still may be of interest.

"28065267,",23935810,Mipmap drawables for icons,"
Since Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean) we can now make use of the res/mipmap folders to store ""mipmap"" images.
For example, Chrome for Android stores its icons in these folders instead of the more normal res/drawable folders.
How are these mipmap images different from the other familiar drawable images?
I see that in my manifest, we use the @mipmap/ qualifier, instead of @drawable/, which makes sense given the resource folder name:
<activity
    android:name="".MipmapDemp""
    android:icon=""@mipmap/ic_launcher"" />


References:
The Android 4.3 APIs document has the following to say:

I don't see anything in there that helps me to understand.

XML Bitmap resources have an android:mipMap property:

Boolean. Enables or disables the mipmap hint. See setHasMipMap() for
  more information. Default value is false.

This does not apply to launcher icons as far as I can see.

The question was raised on Google Groups (The purpose of resource name ""mipmap""?!), to which Romain Guy replied:

It's useful to provide an image at a larger resolution that would
  normally be computed (for instance, on an mdpi device, Launcher might
  want the larger hdpi icon to display large app shortcuts.)

I feel like this almost makes sense of it, but not quite.
I'm still inclined to go with Randy Sugianto's follow up:

What are the advantages of this? Is there any guide how to use
  mipmaps, probably for better launcher icons?


Of course, Wikipedia has a page for ""Mipmap"", which refers to an older technique invented in 1983, that I can't quite relate to the current Android implementation.

Should we be storing all our app icons in res/mipmap folders these days, and what are the guidelines for these mipmap images?

Update #1
Here's a blog post that tries to explain it a bit.

Mipmapping for drawables in Android 4.3

But the image used in that blog post shows what looks like one file with many logos in it. This is not what I see in Chrome's mipmap folder.
Chrome's mipmap-hdpi folder contains three images. One is the Chrome logo, on its own.

Strangely, it is 72x72, not 48x48 which I would expect to see.
Perhaps that is all there is to this - we just need to keep bigger icons in the mipmap folders?

Update #2
The Android Developers Blog post of 23/10/2014 again confirms the idea of using the mipmap folders for application icons:

Getting Your Apps Ready for Nexus 6 and Nexus 9

When talking about the Nexus 6 screen density, the author writes:

It’s best practice to place your app icons in mipmap- folders (not the
  drawable- folders) because they are used at resolutions different from
  the device’s current density. For example, an xxxhdpi app icon can be
  used on the launcher for an xxhdpi device.


Update #3
Note that Android Studio creates the ic_launcher.png icons in the mipmap... folders rather than the drawable... folders that Eclipse used to create them in.

How do I read a file into a std::string, i.e., read the whole file at once?
Text or binary mode should be specified by the caller. The solution should be standard-compliant, portable and efficient. It should not needlessly copy the string's data, and it should avoid reallocations of memory while reading the string.
One way to do this would be to stat the filesize, resize the std::string and fread() into the std::string's const_cast<char*>()'ed data(). This requires the std::string's data to be contiguous which is not required by the standard, but it appears to be the case for all known implementations. What is worse, if the file is read in text mode, the std::string's size may not equal the file's size.
A fully correct, standard-compliant and portable solutions could be constructed using std::ifstream's rdbuf() into a std::ostringstream and from there into a std::string. However, this could copy the string data and/or needlessly reallocate memory. 

Are all relevant standard library implementations smart enough to avoid all unnecessary overhead? 
Is there another way to do it? 
Did I miss some hidden Boost function that already provides the desired functionality?

I'm a C# programmer, but I also wonder whether people use different terms in different languages.

The general consensus seems to be that it's OK to use these terms interchangeably in a team environment. Except perhaps when you're defining the precise terminology; then you can also use ""formal argument/parameter"" and ""actual argument/parameter"" to disambiguate.

What I would like is a method to convert a double to a string which rounds using the half-up method - i.e. if the decimal to be rounded is 5, it always rounds up to the next number. This is the standard method of rounding most people expect in most situations.
I also would like only significant digits to be displayed - i.e. there should not be any trailing zeroes.
I know one method of doing this is to use the String.format method:
String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912385);

returns:
0.91239

which is great, however it always displays numbers with 5 decimal places even if they are not significant: 
String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912300);

returns:
0.91230

Another method is to use the DecimalFormatter:
DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat(""#.#####"");
df.format(0.912385);

returns:
0.91238

However as you can see this uses half-even rounding. That is it will round down if the previous digit is even. What I'd like is this:
0.912385 -> 0.91239
0.912300 -> 0.9123

I'm looking for a class in java that has key-value association, but without using hashes.  Here is what I'm currently doing:

Iterate through all values and:


Get a Map.Entry for the iterator.
Create an object of type Module (a custom class) based on the value.
Add the class to a JPanel.

The problem with this is that I do not have control over the order that I get the values back, so I cannot display the values in the a given order (without hard-coding the order).
I would use an ArrayList or Vector for this, but later in the code I need to grab the Module object for a given Key, which I can't do with an ArrayList or Vector.
Does anyone know of a free/open-source Java class that will do this, or a way to get values out of a Hashtable based on when they were added?

Since gradle android plugins 2.2-alpha4:

But, to download the SDK library you need to: accept the license agreements or gradle tells you:

You have not accepted the license agreements of the following SDK
  components: [Android SDK Build-Tools 24, Android SDK Platform 24].
  Before building your project, you need to accept the license
  agreements and complete the installation of the missing components
  using the Android Studio SDK Manager. Alternatively, to learn how to
  transfer the license agreements from one workstation to another, go to
  http://d.android.com/r/studio-ui/export-licenses.html

And this is a problem because I would love to install all sdk dependencies while doing a gradle build.
I am looking for a solution to automatically accept all licenses. Maybe a gradle script ?
Do you have any ideas ?

[EDIT]
A solution was to execute:

I have a function foo which makes an asynchronous request. How can I return the response/result from foo?
I tried returning the value from the callback, as well as assigning the result to a local variable inside the function and returning that one, but none of those ways actually return the response (they all return undefined or whatever the initial value of the variable result is).
Example using jQuery's ajax function:
function foo() {
    var result;

    $.ajax({
        url: '...',
        success: function(response) {
            result = response;
            // return response; // <- I tried that one as well
        }

    return result; // It always returns `undefined`
}

Example using node.js:
function foo() {

    fs.readFile(""path/to/file"", function(err, data) {
        result = data;
        // return data; // <- I tried that one as well

    return result; // It always returns `undefined`

Example using the then block of a promise:

The idea was to have some vocabulary contained in a json file which would then be loaded into a table. I managed to load the file in and print out one of its values, after which I began writing the code to load the values into the table.
After doing that I started getting an error, so I removed all the code I had written, leaving me with only one line (the same line that had worked before) ... only the error is still there.
The error is as follows:

function loadPageIntoDiv(){
    document.getElementById(""wokabWeeks"").style.display = ""block"";
}

function loadWokab(){
    //also tried getJSON which threw the same error
    jQuery.get('wokab.json', function(data) {
        var glacier = JSON.parse(data);
    });
}

And my JSON file just has the following right now:
[
    {
        ""english"": ""bag"",
        ""kana"": ""kaban"",
        ""kanji"": ""K""

        ""kanji"": ""M""
    }
]

Now the error is reported in line 11 which is the var glacier = JSON.parse(data); line.
When I remove the json file I get the error: ""GET http://.../wokab.json 404 (Not Found)"" so I know it's loading it (or at least trying to).

it seems that it doesn't find the folders (with or without the dirname instruction), or maybe it doesn't know about the cd command ?
it seems that it doesn't understand the install argument to npm
the part that really weirds me out, is that it still runs the app (if I did a npm install manually)...

Not able to make it work properly, and suspecting something weird with the file itself, I created a new one directly on the Mac, using vim this time. I entered the exact same instructions, and... now it works without any issue.
A diff on the two files reveals exactly zero difference.
What can be the difference? What can make the first script not work? How can I find out?
Update
Following the accepted answer's recommandations, after the wrong line endings came back, I checked multiple things. It turns out that since I copied my ~/.gitconfig from my Windows machine, I had autocrlf=true, so every time I modified the bash file under Windows, it re-set the line endings to \r\n.
So, in addition to running dos2unix (which you will have to install using Homebrew on mac), if you're using Git, check your config.

"31875,",6760685,Creating a singleton in Python,"
This question is not for the discussion of whether or not the singleton design pattern is desirable, is an anti-pattern, or for any religious wars, but to discuss how this pattern is best implemented in Python in such a way that is most pythonic. In this instance I define 'most pythonic' to mean that it follows the 'principle of least astonishment'.
I have multiple classes which would become singletons (my use-case is for a logger, but this is not important). I do not wish to clutter several classes with added gumph when I can simply inherit or decorate.
Best methods:

Method 1: A decorator
def singleton(class_):
    instances = {}
    def getinstance(*args, **kwargs):
        if class_ not in instances:
            instances[class_] = class_(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[class_]
    return getinstance

@singleton
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

Decorators are additive in a way that is often more intuitive than multiple inheritance.

Cons

While objects created using MyClass() would be true singleton objects, MyClass itself is a a function, not a class, so you cannot call class methods from it. Also for

x = MyClass();
y = MyClass();
t = type(n)();

then x == y but x != t && y != t

Method 2: A base class
class Singleton(object):
    _instance = None
    def __new__(class_, *args, **kwargs):
        if not isinstance(class_._instance, class_):
            class_._instance = object.__new__(class_, *args, **kwargs)
        return class_._instance

class MyClass(Singleton, BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class

Cons

Multiple inheritance - eugh! __new__ could be overwritten during inheritance from a second base class? One has to think more than is necessary.


Method 3: A metaclass
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super(Singleton, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

#Python2
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    __metaclass__ = Singleton

#Python3
class MyClass(BaseClass, metaclass=Singleton):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class
Auto-magically covers inheritance
Uses __metaclass__ for its proper purpose (and made me aware of it)

Cons

Are there any?


Method 4: decorator returning a class with the same name
def singleton(class_):
    class class_w(class_):
        _instance = None
        def __new__(class_, *args, **kwargs):
            if class_w._instance is None:
                class_w._instance = super(class_w,
                                    class_).__new__(class_,
                                                    *args,
                                                    **kwargs)
                class_w._instance._sealed = False
            return class_w._instance
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            if self._sealed:
                return
            super(class_w, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            self._sealed = True
    class_w.__name__ = class_.__name__
    return class_w

@singleton
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class
Auto-magically covers inheritance

Cons

Is there not an overhead for creating each new class? Here we are creating two classes for each class we wish to make a singleton. While this is fine in my case, I worry that this might not scale. Of course there is a matter of debate as to whether it aught to be too easy to scale this pattern...
What is the point of the _sealed attribute
Can't call methods of the same name on base classes using super() because they will recurse. This means you can't customize __new__ and can't subclass a class that needs you to call up to __init__.


Method 5: a module
a module file singleton.py

Simple is better than complex

Cons

Not lazily instantianted

"440739,",1634268,Explain the encapsulated anonymous function syntax,"
Summary
Can you explain the reasoning behind the syntax for encapsulated anonymous functions in JavaScript? Why does this work: (function(){})(); but this doesn't: function(){}();?

What I know
In JavaScript, one creates a named function like this:
function twoPlusTwo(){
    alert(2 + 2);
}
twoPlusTwo();

You can also create an anonymous function and assign it to a variable:
var twoPlusTwo = function(){
    alert(2 + 2);
};
twoPlusTwo();

You can encapsulate a block of code by creating an anonymous function, then wrapping it in brackets and executing it immediately:
(function(){
    alert(2 + 2);
})();

This is useful when creating modularised scripts, to avoid cluttering up the current scope, or global scope, with potentially conflicting variables - as in the case of Greasemonkey scripts, jQuery plugins, etc.
Now, I understand why this works. The brackets enclose the contents and expose only the outcome (I'm sure there's a better way to describe that), such as with (2 + 2) === 4.

What I don't understand
But I don't understand why this does not work equally as well:
function(){
    alert(2 + 2);
}();

Can you explain that to me?

I can't be the only one on the planet having issue with Visual Studio 2015 and the new and ""improved"" NuGet Package Manager.  
UPDATE:
Well, must be something odd in my solution because I created a new project from the VS2015 template (web) and the packages install just fine.  When I find out the issue, I'll post the resolution in the event others run into the same problem.  
UPDATE 2:
Ok, it's not our solution.  We created a new solution from scratch again (this has wasted a lot of our development time might I add), added a couple of packages (Identity, EF, SendGrid) and after checking the solution in to VSO, another developer performs a fresh creation of the branch and build errors occur.  When I go to the NuGet packages for an individual project, it acts as though none of the packages I have added are available.  Anyone else experiencing this?

I need a bit of help straightening out something, I know it's a very easy easy question but it's something that is slightly confusing me in SQL.
This SQL query throws a 'not a GROUP BY expression' error in Oracle. I understand why, as I know that once I group by an attribute of a tuple, I can no longer access any other attribute.
SELECT * 
FROM order_details 
GROUP BY order_no

However this one does work
SELECT SUM(order_price)
FROM order_details
GROUP BY order_no

Just to concrete my understanding on this.... Assuming that there are multiple tuples in order_details for each order that is made, once I group the tuples according to order_no, I can still access the order_price attribute for each individual tuple in the group, but only using an aggregate function?
In other words, aggregate functions when used in the SELECT clause are able to drill down into the group to see the 'hidden' attributes, where simply using 'SELECT order_no' will throw an error?

I know the so-called textbook definition of unit tests and integration tests.  What I am curious about is when it is time to write unit tests... I will write them to cover as many sets of classes as possible.
For example, if I have a Word class, I will write some unit tests for the Word class.  Then, I begin writing my Sentence class, and when it needs to interact with the Word class, I will often write my unit tests such that they test both Sentence and Word... at least in the places where they interact.
Have these tests essentially become integration tests because they now test the integration of these 2 classes, or is it just a unit test that spans 2 classes?
In general, because of this uncertain line, I will rarely actually write integration tests... or is my using the finished product to see if all the pieces work properly the actual integration tests, even though they are manual and rarely repeated beyond the scope of each individual feature?
Am I misunderstanding integration tests, or is there really just very little difference between integration and unit tests?

When my Activity starts, the EditText immediately has input focus (flashing cursor). I don't want any control to have input focus at startup. I tried:
EditText.setSelected(false);
EditText.setFocusable(false);

No luck. How can I convince the EditText to not select itself when the Activity starts?

Most OO languages prefix their interface names with a capital I, why does Java not do this?  What was the rationale for not following this convention?
To demonstrate what I mean, if I wanted to have a User interface and a User implementation I'd have two choices in Java:

Where in most languages:

Class = User, Interface = IUser

Now, you might argue that you could always pick a most descriptive name for the user implementation and the problem goes away, but Java's pushing a POJO approach to things and   most IOC containers use DynamicProxies extensively.  These two things together mean that you'll have lots of interfaces with a single POJO implementation.
So, I guess my question boils down to: ""Is it worth following the broader Interface naming convention especially in light of where Java Frameworks seem to be heading?""

1  11  110

Now I want to iterate over the rows of this frame. For every row I want to be able to access its elements (values in cells) by the name of the columns. For example:
for row in df.rows:
   print row['c1'], row['c2']

Is it possible to do that in Pandas?
I found this similar question. But it does not give me the answer I need. For example, it is suggested there to use:

or
for row in df.iterrows():

"1472498,",793100,Globally catch exceptions in a WPF application?,"
We are having a WPF application where parts of it may throw exceptions at runtime. I'd like to globally catch any unhandled exception and log them, but otherwise continue program execution as if nothing happened (kinda like VB's On Error Resume Next).
Is this possible in C#? And if so, where exactly would I need to put the exception handling code?
Currently I can't see any single point where I could wrap a try/catch around and which would catch all exceptions that could occur. And even then I would have left whatever has been executed because of the catch. Or am I thinking in horribly wrong directions here?
ETA: Because many people below pointed it out: The application is not for controlling nuclear power plants. If it crashes it's not that much a big deal but random exceptions that are mostly UI-related are a nuisance in the context where it would be used. There were (and probably still are) a few of those and since it uses a plugin architecture and may be extended by others (also students in that case; so no experienced developers that are able to write completely error-free code).
As for the exceptions that get caught: I do log them to a log file, including the complete stack trace. That was the whole point of that exercise. Just to counter those people  that were taking my analogy to VB's OERN too literally.
I know that blindly ignoring certain classes of errors is dangerous and might corrupt my application instance. As said before, this program isn't mission-critical for anyone. No-one in their right mind would bet the survival of the human civilization on it. It's simply a little tool for testing certain design approaches wrt. software engineering.
For the immediate use of the application there are not many things that can happen on an exception:

No exception handling – error dialog and application exit. Experiment has to be repeated, though likely with another subject. No errors have been logged, which is unfortunate.
Generic exception handling – benign error trapped, no harm done. This should be the common case judged from all errors we were seeing during development. Ignoring this kind of errors should have no immediate consequences; the core data structures are tested well enough that they will easily survive this.
Generic exception handling – serious error trapped, possibly crash at a later point. This may happen rarely. We've never seen it so far. The error is logged anyway and a crash might be inevitable. So this is conceptually similar to the very first case. Except that we have a stack trace. And in the majority of cases the user won't even notice.

As for the experiment data generated by the program: A serious error would at worst just cause no data to be recorded. Subtle changes that change the result of the experiment ever so slightly are pretty unlikely. And even in that case, if the results seem dubious the error was logged; one can still throw away that data point if it's a total outlier.
To summarize: Yes, I consider myself still at least partially sane and I don't consider a global exception handling routine which leaves the program running to be necessarily totally evil. As said twice before, such a decision might be valid, depending on the application. In this case it was judged a valid decision and not total and utter bullshit. For any other application that decision might look different. But please don't accuse me or the other people who worked on that project to potentially blow up the world just because we're ignoring errors.
Side note: There is exactly one user for that application. It's not something like Windows or Office that gets used by millions where the cost of having exceptions bubble to the user at all would be very different in the first place already.

I'm looking for a counter-part of git commit --amend in Mercurial, i.e. a way to modify the commit which my working copy is linked to. I'm only interested in the last commit, not an arbitrary earlier commit.
The requirements for this amend-procedure are:

if possible, it should not require any extensions. It must not require non-default extensions, i.e. extensions which do not come with an official Mercurial installation.
if the commit to amend is one head of my current branch, no new head should be created. If the commit is not head, a new head may be created.
the procedure should be safe in a way that if for whatever reasons the amending fails, I want to have the same working copy and repository state restored as before the amending. With other words, if the amending itself can fail, there should be a fail-safe procedure to restore the working copy and repository state. I'm referring to ""failures"" which lie in the nature of the amend-procedure (like e.g. conflicts), not to file-system-related problems (like access restrictions, not being able to lock a file for writing, ...)

Update (1):

the procedure must be automatable, so it can be performed by a GUI client without any user interaction required.

Update (2):

files in the working directory must not be touched (there may be file system locks on certain modified files). This especially means, that a possible approach may at no point require a clean working directory.

"2943556,",335311,What is the difference between a static and a non-static initialization code block,"
My question is about one particular usage of static keyword. It is possible to use static keyword to cover a code block within a class which does not belong to any function. For example following code compiles:
public class Test {
    private static final int a;    
    static {
        a = 5;
        doSomething(a);
    }
    private static int doSomething(int x) {
        return (x+5);
    }
}

If you remove the static keyword it complains because the variable a is final. However it is possible to remove both final and static keywords and make it compile. 
It is confusing for me in both ways. How am I supposed to have a code section that does not belong to any method? How is it possible to invoke it? In general, what is the purpose of this usage? Or better, where can I find documentation about this?

I like how Java has a Map where you can define the types of each entry in the map, for example <String, Integer>. 
What I'm looking for is a type of collection where each element in the collection is a pair of values.  Each value in the pair can have its own type (like the String and Integer example above), which is defined at declaration time.  
The collection will maintain its given order and will not treat one of the values as a unique key (as in a map).  
Essentially I want to be able to define an ARRAY of type <String,Integer> or any other 2 types.  
I realize that I can make a class with nothing but the 2 variables in it, but that seems overly verbose.  
I also realize that I could use a 2D array, but because of the different types I need to use, I'd have to make them arrays of OBJECT, and then I'd have to cast all the time.

A friend asked me last week how to enumerate or list all variables within a program/function/etc. for the purposes of debugging (essentially getting a snapshot of everything so you can see what variables are set to, or if they are set at all). I looked around a bit and found a relatively good way for Python:

#!/usr/bin/python                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
foo1 = ""Hello world""
foo2 = ""bar""
foo3 = {""1"":""a"",
        ""2"":""b""}
foo4 = ""1+1""

for name in dir():
    myvalue = eval(name)
    print name, ""is"", type(name), ""and is equal to "", myvalue

which will output something like:

__builtins__ is <type 'str'> and is equal to  <module '__builtin__' (built-in)>
__doc__ is <type 'str'> and is equal to  None
__file__ is <type 'str'> and is equal to  ./foo.py
__name__ is <type 'str'> and is equal to  __main__
foo1 is <type 'str'> and is equal to  Hello world
foo2 is <type 'str'> and is equal to  bar
foo3 is <type 'str'> and is equal to  {'1': 'a', '2': 'b'}
foo4 is <type 'str'> and is equal to  1+1

I have so far found a partial way in PHP (courtesy of link text) but it only lists all variables and their types, not the contents:

<?php
// create a few variables
$bar = 'foo';
$foo ='bar';
// create a new array object
$arrayObj = new ArrayObject(get_defined_vars());
// loop over the array object and echo variables and values
for($iterator = $arrayObj->getIterator(); $iterator->valid(); $iterator->next())
        {
        echo $iterator->key() . ' => ' . $iterator->current() . '<br />';
        }
?>

So I put it to you: how do you list all variables and their contents in your favorite language?

DataGridViewCell cell = dgv[1,5];

but for the life of me I can't find the documentation on the index/square-bracket operator.  What do they call it?  Where is it implemented?  Can it throw?  How can I do the same thing in my own classes?
ETA: Thanks for all the quick answers.  Briefly: the relevant documentation is under the ""Item"" property; the way to overload is by declaring a property like public object this[int x, int y]{ get{...}; set{...} }; the indexer for DataGridView does not throw, at least according to the documentation.  It doesn't mention what happens if you supply invalid coordinates.
ETA Again: OK, even though the documentation makes no mention of it (naughty Microsoft!), it turns out that the indexer for DataGridView will in fact throw an ArgumentOutOfRangeException if you supply it with invalid coordinates.  Fair warning.

"6363441,",2937407,Test whether a glob has any matches in bash,"
If I want to check for the existence of a single file, I can test for it using test -e filename or [ -e filename ].
Supposing I have a glob and I want to know whether any files exist whose names match the glob. The glob can match 0 files (in which case I need to do nothing), or it can match 1 or more files (in which case I need to do something). How can I test whether a glob has any matches? (I don't care how many matches there are, and it would be best if I could do this with one if statement and no loops (simply because I find that most readable).
(test -e glob* fails if the glob matches more than one file.)

"19038799,",5078239,How do I remove the space between inline/inline-block elements?,"
Given this HTML and CSS:


span {
    display:inline-block;
    width:100px;
    background-color:palevioletred;
}
<p>
    <span> Foo </span>
    <span> Bar </span>
</p>



As a result, there will be a 4 pixel wide space between the SPAN elements.
Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/dGHFV/
I understand why this happens, and I also know that I could get rid of that space by removing the white-space between the SPAN elements in the HTML source code, like so:
<p>
    <span> Foo </span><span> Bar </span>
</p>

However, I was hoping for a CSS solution that doesn't require the HTML source code to be tampered with.
I know how to solve this with JavaScript - by removing the text nodes from the container element (the paragraph), like so:
// jQuery
$('p').contents().filter(function() { return this.nodeType === 3; }).remove();

Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/dGHFV/1/
But can this issue be solved with CSS alone?

"1101841,",914109,How to use LINQ to select object with minimum or maximum property value,"
I have a Person object with a Nullable DateOfBirth property.  Is there a way to use LINQ to query a list of Person objects for the one with the earliest/smallest DateOfBirth value.
Here's what I started with:
var firstBornDate = People.Min(p => p.DateOfBirth.GetValueOrDefault(DateTime.MaxValue));

Null DateOfBirth values are set to DateTime.MaxValue in order to rule them out of the Min consideration (assuming at least one has a specified DOB).
But all that does for me is to set firstBornDate to a DateTime value.  What I'd like to get is the Person object that matches that.  Do I need to write a second query like so:
var firstBorn = People.Single(p=> (p.DateOfBirth ?? DateTime.MaxValue) == firstBornDate);

Or is there a leaner way of doing it?
