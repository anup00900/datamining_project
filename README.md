QUES:To Find Semantically Similar Questions to a given Question and Rank them. 


Problem DefinitionThe problem is defined as follows: Given a question q, identify questions in the corpus that are similar and related to this Question semantically.
Take an example of q being, “How can I get rid of my fear of swimming?”We show questions which are “related” to this question – one of the criteria is 
"semantic identity" or "exact question match". Hence, It would contain questionsthat are exact duplicates of the above question and also paraphrases of the form
“How can I overcome my fear of swimming?”In our definition of paraphrasing, there needs to be at least one semantic identityconcept between two questions qualified as 
paraphrases of each other.
